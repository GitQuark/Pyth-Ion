#Pyth-Ion

Pyth-Ion is an open source nanopore data analysis package created by Robert Henley for the Wanunu Lab.

The package currently works exclusively with data files obtained using Chimera megahertz amplifiers. If you'd like for me to add functionality to load any data file type that you need just send me a message or email me at roberthenley89@gmail.com

##Installing

**_IMPORTANT_** : It is of critical importance that Pyth-Ion be run using a 64-bit version of Python 2.7! Especially for use with Chimera files

###Dependencies

The following packages are prerequisites for Pyth-Ion

1. scipy
2. numpy
3. pyqtgraph
4. PyQt4
5. Pandas

Scientific distributions such as Anaconda or WinPython should have most if not all of these packages preinstalled

Once you have these packages simply download the Pyth-Ion .zip and unpack the folder to wherever you choose. Then navigate to the Pyth-Ion folder from command prompt (or terminal if you're using a mac) and type "python pythion.py" and the Pyth-Ion GUI should appear.
